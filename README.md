<p>
This is the github of an aspiring bioinformatician. I graduated from the <a href="https://bioinf.me/en">Bioinformatics Institute</a> as a biostatistician and bioinformatician and the <a href="https://msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov Moscow State University</a> with BSc and MSc degrees in Biophysics. My experience encompasses collaboration with virologists, biochemists, and immunologists. However, my primary passion lies in researching the structure and properties of proteins.

<b>Research experience</b>
</summary><br> 
  
### Studying population frequencies of T-cell receptor (TCR) alleles using immune repertoire sequencing
<!--Publication/Results-->
[Repo](https://github.com/Olga-Bagrova/RepSeq_TCRanalysis)

*Comprehensive analysis of the TCR repertoire for a large group of donors.*

We analyzed:
* Gene usage distribution of the TRA and TRB chains for the identification of deletions
* Co-expression factors for V-V, J-J, V-J pairs within and between TRA and TRB chains 
* Genes usage between only functional and non-functional sequences to identify thymus selection
* We also compared found patterns between populations

* **Skills:** Python (*scipy, statsmodels, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, re, os*), Bash, Jupyterhub, Conda, Biological databases (*IMGT*). <br>

  

### The analysis of the secondary structures distributions along the polypeptide chains of proteins within different functional classes, homologous proteins and topologous proteins
<!--Results. -->
[Repo](https://github.com/Olga-Bagrova/DistrProtStruc)

*Development of a new representation of proteins for comparing structures with a focus on the secondary structures distribution.*

* New representation of protein molecules using the distributions of secondary structures along their chains was developed
* Proteins from PDB were divided into groups according to function and homology
* Frequencies of occurrence of various secondary structures for the selected groups were compared

* **Skills:** Python (*biotite, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, re, os*), Bash, Conda, Biological databases (*PDB, CATH, UniProt, NCBI, PFam, GO*). <br>



### Biostatistical analysis of melanoma patients‚Äô transcriptomic data from open database TCGA
<!--Results. -->
[Repo](https://github.com/Olga-Bagrova/TCGA_SKCM)

*Analyzing transcriptomic data from melanoma samples to identify trends in gene expression and building a model to predict overall survival based on expression levels.*

* The study of clinical and transcriptomic data of patients with melanoma to identify patient groups and their patterns
* Transcriptomic signatures were selected based on a literature review and Cox regression to predict overall patient survival
* A survival prediction model using Cox regression has been developed

* **Skills:** R (*survival, survminer, glmnet, ComplexHeatmap, tidyverse, gtsummary, factoextra, ggbiplot, ggplot2, ggpubr, dplyr, plotly, tibble, matrixStats*), Biological databases (*TCGA, GO*).<br>
